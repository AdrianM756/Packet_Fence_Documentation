## Packet Fence

[Packet Fence](https://www.packetfence.org/) is a fully supported, trusted, Free and Open Source network access control (NAC) solution. Boasting an impressive feature set including a captive-portal for registration and remediation, centralized wired, wireless and VPN management, industry-leading BYOD capabilities, 802.1X and RBAC support, integrated network anomaly detection with layer-2 isolation of problematic devices; PacketFence can be used to effectively secure small to very large heterogeneous networks.

## Packet Fence installation on Proxmox

On this demo, we will be downloading the [Debian ISO image for Packet Fence](https://us-ord-1.linodeobjects.com/packetfence-iso/v14.1.0/PacketFence-ISO-v14.1.0.iso)
<br>

On our Proxmox machine download the ISO file by querying the URL. We can achieve this by:
<br>
* Selecting the compute node to which to upload the ISO image.
* Select the ```ISO image file``` and click ```Download from URL```.
